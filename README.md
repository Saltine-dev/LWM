Have you ever launched the non-Steam version of a Steam game and realised the there is suddenly no mod support? You can still get workshop mods, but only by going through SteamCMD console, installing mods one by one, and dumping them into an ever-growing folder you can’t organise or keep current. Many developers ship across multiple platforms, but only Steam users get to enjoy the streamlined mod experience. Local Workshop Manager bridges that gap, bringing Workshop-quality mod discovery, collections, and updates to every copy, without the manual work.
